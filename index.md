At the University of Tasmania I co-coordinated, developed online material (e.g. web-games, quiz, video presentations) for, and tutored a unit about rational decision making in uncertainty.

In regards to my tutoring, anonymous feedback from students described me as “one of the most helpful aspects of the unit”.

See the [Unit Description here](https://www.utas.edu.au/courses/chm/units/psy115-big-decisions!-rational-belief-and-action-in-an-uncertain-world?year=2021&SQ_CONTEXT_NAME=2021&SQ_ACTION=set_context)
