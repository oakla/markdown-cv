Motivated by my enthusiasm for partner acrobatics, and a desire to develop the community I felt a part of, I founded the UTAS Acrobatics Society. Each week we held meet-ups where we created an emotionally and physically safe space to practice partner acrobatics. 

Three or four times a year we ran structured special events. These were either workshops with the help of grants from the university student union, or participation in university open days.

During my time at the society, we were awarded $2,700 in grants, and raised $1,600 in member contributions.
